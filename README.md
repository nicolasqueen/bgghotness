This is my first JavaScript Project. 

I wanted a way to display the current 50 games 
listed as the HOTNESS on the BoardGameGeek website (https://www.boardgamegeek.com/).

To do this, I used AJAX and jQuery to access the JSON
API available at https://bgg-json.azurewebsites.net/ as BoardGameGeek only has an XML 
API available. 

I will be continuing to improve it as needed, especially in trying to figure out 
a better grid system. A difficulty I have found is that the games have various shaped 
thumbnails and this has broke whatever system I have used.
